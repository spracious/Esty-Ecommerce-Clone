Navigation Icons
Our Esty Clone project features a navigation bar with icons representing different categories. Currently, only the "Vintage" button is active, providing users with a clear indication of the selected category.

Active State
When you navigate to the site, you will notice that the "Vintage" button is visually distinguished from the other buttons. It has a unique background color and text color to signify its active state.

If you wish to explore other categories, feel free to click on the respective buttons. However, please note that only the "Vintage" category is set to the active state at the moment.
